# Multi-Threading Matrix Multiplication

This project measures the time taken for matrix multiplication using different numbers of threads in Python. It utilizes multi-threading to parallelize the matrix multiplication process and generates a plot illustrating the relationship between the number of threads and the average time taken. Additionally, it saves the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage

To run the code, simply execute the `multi_threading_matrix_multiplication.py` script. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas).

```bash
python multi_threading_matrix_multiplication.py
